I believe the future of science lies in the co-evolution of synthetic biology and AI. My work focuses on tackling one of the field's central challenges -- data scarcity -- by developing next-generation synthetic biology tools that integrate with machine learning. This dual approach enables us not only to answer fundamental biological questions, but also to accelerate translation into real therapies, diagnostics, and engineered living systems.

Currently, I am Director of Molecular Processing and Automation at [Aureka Biotechnologies](https://www.aurekabio.com/), where I lead the design, optimization, and automation of molecular workflows for high-throughput antibody and protein engineering.

Trained in Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering (PhD, [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/); Postdoctoral Fellow, [MIT Collins Lab](https://collinslab.mit.edu/)), I specialize in RNA therapeutics, synthetic cells, and AI-driven molecular design. I also held fellowships at [Flagship Pioneering](https://www.flagshippioneering.com/) and [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/) (VoyagerX). My earlier education includes an MRes in Synthetic and Systems Biology from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) and a BSc in Biotechnology from [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/).
