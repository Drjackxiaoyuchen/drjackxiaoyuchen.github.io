Welcome to my writing corner. This space will host creative writing, essays, and reflections on science, technology, and life.

I have always been drawn to storytelling -- both in the lab and on the page. Science, at its core, is about narrative: asking questions, discovering patterns, and sharing what we find. Fiction lets us explore different kinds of truth.

Stay tuned for novel fiction, short essays, and more. In the future, I plan to integrate pieces from [Medium](https://medium.com/) as well.

If you'd like to get in touch about writing or collaboration, feel free to reach out via the links on the [about page](/).
